Overview
This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration
posture for Microsoft Windows Server. To obtain the latest version of this guide, please
visit https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/. If you have questions, comments, or
have identified ways to improve this guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org.

Intended Audience
The Windows CIS Benchmarks are written for Active Directory domain-joined systems
using Group Policy, not standalone/workgroup systems. Adjustments/tailoring to some
recommendations will be needed to maintain functionality if attempting to implement CIS
hardening on standalone systems or a system running in the cloud.

Consensus Guidance
This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of
backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security
research, operations, government, and legal.
Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the
benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit
https://workbench.cisecurity.org/.

Recommendations
1 Account Policies
This section contains recommendations for account policies.

1.1 Password Policy
This section contains recommendations for password policy.

1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more
password(s)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be
associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this
policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is
0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the
effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users
from repeatedly changing their password.
The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).

40 | P a g e

Rationale:
The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can
determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have
been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If
password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually
reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly
reduced.
If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small
number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age
setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original
password.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 24 or
more password(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Enforce password history

Impact:
The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time
they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords
to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords
somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on)
to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for
the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because
users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.
Default Value:
24 passwords remembered on domain members. 0 passwords remembered on stand-alone
servers.

1.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '60 or fewer days,
but not 0' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.
Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the
password will never expire.
Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the
less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value
is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users
having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.
The recommended state for this setting is 60 or fewer days, but not 0.
Rationale:
The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a
brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user
sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users
are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a
compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has
authorized access.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

43 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 60 or
fewer days, but not 0:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Maximum password age

Impact:
If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their
passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization,
because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value
for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced
because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to
use compromised accounts.
Default Value:
42 days.

1.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before
you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days.
(You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value
for this setting is 0 days.
The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s).
Rationale:
Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to
remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise.
Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific
individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old
passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of
security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history
setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce
password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords,
they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they
started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that
is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0
for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

45 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 1 or more
day(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password age

Impact:
If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password
when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password
at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the password until the next
day.
Default Value:
1 day on domain members. 0 days on stand-alone servers.

1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more
character(s)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for
a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best
password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a better term than
"password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, pass phrases can be quite long and can
include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass
phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random
numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the
proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length.
In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14
characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business
requirements.
The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).
Rationale:
Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words
and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters).
Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to
discover the accounts and passwords.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

47 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or
more character(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password length

Impact:
Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an
organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If
very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and
increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass
phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character
combinations, much harder to discover.
Note: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support
passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating
systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that
require long passwords.
Default Value:
7 characters on domain members. 0 characters on stand-alone servers.

1.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set
to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements
for strong passwords.
When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:




Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two
consecutive characters
Be at least six characters in length
Contain characters from three of the following categories:
o English uppercase characters (A through Z)
o English lowercase characters (a through z)
o Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
o Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
o A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the
previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267
(approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per
second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes
to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527
combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without
punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011)
possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000
attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember,
these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other
special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can
help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

50 | P a g e

Rationale:
Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with
several publicly available tools.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements

Impact:
If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for
locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that
contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the
complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.
If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom
version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength
rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row
characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key
and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform
a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common
dictionary words or fragments.
Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a
password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users
and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a
requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159
range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric
characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)
Default Value:
Enabled on domain members. Disabled on stand-alone servers.

1.1.6 (L1) Ensure 'Store passwords using reversible encryption' is set to
'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way
that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that
require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are
stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the
passwords.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Enabling this policy setting allows the operating system to store passwords in a weaker
format that is much more susceptible to compromise and weakens your system security.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Store passwords using reversible encryption

Impact:
If your organization uses either the CHAP authentication protocol through remote access or
IAS services or Digest Authentication in IIS, you must configure this policy setting to
Enabled. This setting is extremely dangerous to apply through Group Policy on a user-byuser basis, because it requires the appropriate user account object to be opened in Active
Directory Users and Computers.

1.2 Account Lockout Policy
This section contains recommendations for account lockout policy.

1.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more
minute(s)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is
unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number
of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting
is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator
manually unlocks them.
Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a
high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk
receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time
a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have
an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
Rationale:
A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout
threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific account. Once you configure the
Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number
of failed attempts. If you configure the Account lockout duration setting to 0, then the
account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it manually.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

55 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 15 or
more minute(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Account lockout duration

Impact:
Although it may seem like a good idea to configure this policy setting to never
automatically unlock an account, such a configuration can increase the number of requests
that your organization's help desk receives to unlock accounts that were locked by mistake.
Default Value:
None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold is
specified. When an Account lockout threshold is configured, Windows automatically
suggests a value of 30 minutes.

1.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout threshold' is set to '10 or fewer
invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before the account is
locked. Setting this policy to 0 does not conform to the benchmark as doing so disables the
account lockout threshold.
The recommended state for this setting is: 10 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but
not 0.
Rationale:
Setting an account lockout threshold reduces the likelihood that an online password brute
force attack will be successful. Setting the account lockout threshold too low introduces
risk of increased accidental lockouts and/or a malicious actor intentionally locking out
accounts.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 10 or
fewer invalid login attempt(s), but not 0:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Account lockout threshold

57 | P a g e

Impact:
If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an
administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting may generate
additional help desk calls.
If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by
deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure
the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value.
If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's
attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a
robust audit mechanism is not in place.
Default Value:
0 failed logon attempts.

1.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Reset account lockout counter after' is set to '15 or
more minute(s)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold
resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout
threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account
lockout duration setting.
If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that
is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could
maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization,
which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account
lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time
value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until
all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.
The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
Rationale:
Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password
multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout
counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the
counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

59 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 15 or
more minute(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Reset account lockout counter after

Impact:
If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is
too long, a DoS attack could occur. An attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to each
user's account numerous times and lock out their accounts as described in the preceding
paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after setting,
administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this policy
setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after which
their accounts would unlock automatically. Be sure that you notify users of the values used
for this policy setting so that they will wait for the lockout timer to expire before they call
the help desk about their inability to log on.
Default Value:
None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold is
specified. When an Account lockout threshold is configured, Windows automatically
suggests a value of 30 minutes.

Description:
This security setting is used by Credential Manager during Backup and Restore. No

2.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Access this computer from the network' is set to
'Administrators, Authenticated Users, ENTERPRISE DOMAIN
CONTROLLERS' (DC only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is
required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)-based
protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model
Plus (COM+).
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Authenticated Users,
ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS.
Rationale:
Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target
computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this computer from
the network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If
this user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone will be able to read the files
in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of Windows
Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS permissions in
Windows Server 2003 do not include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a
higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows
2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as
the default permissions in Windows Server 2003.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, configure the following UI path:

Policies\User Rights Assignment\Access this computer from the network

63 | P a g e

Impact:
If you remove the Access this computer from the network user right on Domain
Controllers for all users, no one will be able to log on to the domain or use network
resources. If you remove this user right on Member Servers, users will not be able to
connect to those servers through the network. Successful negotiation of IPsec connections
requires that the initiating machine has this right, therefore if using IPsec, it is
recommended that it is assigned to the Authenticated Users group. If you have installed
optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services (IIS), you may need
to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. It is
important to verify that authorized users are assigned this user right for the computers
they need to access the network.

2.2.5 (L1) Ensure 'Add workstations to domain' is set to 'Administrators'
(DC only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting specifies which users can add computer workstations to the domain. For
this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the Default
Domain Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right can add
up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the Create Computer
Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an
unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether or not they have
been assigned the Add workstations to domain user right.
In Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or
computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources.
In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the
ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may
want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers
to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could
perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create
additional unauthorized domain computers.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
The Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users with
this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates
organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users
to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could (re-)install Windows on
his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user would know the
password for the local Administrator account, and could log on with that account and then
add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group.

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
Administrators:

Impact:
For organizations that have never allowed users to set up their own computers and add
them to the domain, this countermeasure will have no impact. For those that have allowed
some or all users to configure their own computers, this countermeasure will force the
organization to establish a formal process for these procedures going forward. It will not
affect existing domain computers unless they are removed from and re-added to the
domain.
Default Value:
Authenticated Users. (All domain users have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts
to an Active Directory domain. These new computer accounts are created in the Computers
container.)

2.2.6 (L1) Ensure 'Adjust memory quotas for a process' is set to
'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows a user to adjust the maximum amount of memory that is available
to a process. The ability to adjust memory quotas is useful for system tuning, but it can be
abused. In the wrong hands, it could be used to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK
SERVICE.
Note: A Member Server that holds the Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Server Role Service
will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application pool(s) to
be granted this user right.
Note #2: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server installed will require a special
exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this
user right.
Rationale:
A user with the Adjust memory quotas for a process user right can reduce the amount of
memory that is available to any process, which could cause business-critical network
applications to become slow or to fail. In the wrong hands, this privilege could be used to
start a denial of service (DoS) attack.

Impact:
Organizations that have not restricted users to roles with limited privileges will find it
difficult to impose this countermeasure. Also, if you have installed optional components
such as ASP.NET or IIS, you may need to assign the Adjust memory quotas for a process
user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. Otherwise, this
countermeasure should have no impact on most computers. If this user right is necessary
for a user account, it can be assigned to a local computer account instead of a domain
account.

Description:
This policy setting determines which users can interactively log on to computers in your
environment. Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence on
the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on through
Terminal Services / Remote Desktop Services or IIS also require this user right.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Note: This user right should generally be restricted to the Administrators group. Assign
this user right to the Backup Operators group if your organization requires that they have
this capability.
Rationale:
Any account with the Allow log on locally user right can log on at the console of the
computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to be able to
log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run
malicious software to elevate their privileges.

2.2.10 (L1) Ensure 'Back up files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows users to circumvent file and directory permissions to back up the
system. This user right is enabled only when an application (such as NTBACKUP) attempts to
access a file or directory through the NTFS file system backup application programming
interface (API). Otherwise, the assigned file and directory permissions apply.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Rationale:
Users who are able to back up data from a computer could take the backup media to a nondomain computer on which they have administrative privileges and restore the data. They
could take ownership of the files and view any unencrypted data that is contained within
the backup set.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
Administrators.
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\User Rights Assignment\Back up files and directories

79 | P a g e

Impact:
Changes in the membership of the groups that have the Back up files and directories user
right could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in
your environment. You should confirm that authorized backup administrators are still able
to perform backup operations.
Default Value:
On Member Servers: Administrators, Backup Operators.
On Domain Controllers: Administrators, Backup Operators, Server Operators.

2.2.11 (L1) Ensure 'Change the system time' is set to 'Administrators,
LOCAL SERVICE' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the
internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right
can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged
events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.
Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain
Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication
protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain
authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will
occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
synchronized with the Domain Controllers.

81 | P a g e

Rationale:
Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example,
time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders
that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain
may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from
them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and
authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period,
an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain
or grant Kerberos tickets.
The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member
Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically
synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:





All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain
Controller as their inbound time partner.
All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC)
Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.
All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the
selection of their inbound time partner.
The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for
the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to
synchronize with a reliable external time server.

This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system
time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time
server that is not accurate.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\User Rights Assignment\Change the system time

82 | P a g e

Impact:
There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be
fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not belong
to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source.
Default Value:
On Member Servers: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.
On Domain Controllers: Administrators, Server Operators, LOCAL SERVICE.

This setting determines which users can change the time zone of the computer. This ability
holds no great danger for the computer and may be useful for mobile workers.

2.2.14 (L1) Ensure 'Create a token object' is set to 'No One' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
This policy setting allows a process to create an access token, which may provide elevated
rights to access sensitive data.
The recommended state for this setting is: No One.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Rationale:
A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and can
lead to the system being compromised. It is highly recommended that you do not assign
any user accounts this right.
The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the user's
privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or connect to a
remote computer over a network. When you revoke a privilege, the change is immediately
recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until the next time the
user logs on or connects. Users with the ability to create or modify tokens can change the
level of access for any currently logged on account. They could escalate their own privileges
or create a DoS condition.

Description:
This policy setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available to
all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not
have this user right.
Users who can create global objects could affect processes that run under other users'
sessions. This capability could lead to a variety of problems, such as application failure or
data corruption.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK
SERVICE, SERVICE.
Note: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server and its optional "Integration Services"
component installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional
SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.
Rationale:
Users who can create global objects could affect Windows services and processes that run

2.2.17 (L1) Ensure 'Create symbolic links' is set to 'Administrators' (DC
only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista,
existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a
new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like
a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or
another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a
shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications,
shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is
implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not
designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only
be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
Users who have the Create symbolic links user right could inadvertently or maliciously
expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to change
the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a Denial of Service attack.

2.2.19 (L1) Ensure 'Debug programs' is set to 'Administrators' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a debugger
to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical
operating system components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do
not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new
system components will need it.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Rationale:
The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer
information from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures.
Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private
security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right
is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
Administrators:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\User Rights Assignment\Debug programs

98 | P a g e

Impact:
If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical
circumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises
that requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the
server to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a
separate Group Policy for that OU.
The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs user
right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail.
Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not
owned by the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource
Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate processes that
they did not start.

2.2.20 (L1) Ensure 'Deny access to this computer from the network' to
include 'Guests' (DC only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network,
which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security
environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on a computer.
Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network servers. This user
right supersedes the Access this computer from the network user right if an account is
subject to both policies.
The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.
Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may
result in an inability to remotely administer the server.
Note: The security identifier Local account and member of Administrators group is not
available in Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 (non-R2) unless MSKB 2871997 has been
installed.
Note #2: Configuring a Member Server or standalone server as described above may
adversely affect applications that create a local service account and place it in the
Administrators group - in which case you must either convert the application to use a
domain-hosted service account, or remove Local account and member of
Administrators group from this User Right Assignment. Using a domain-hosted service
account is strongly preferred over making an exception to this rule, where possible.
Rationale:
Users who can log on to the computer over the network can enumerate lists of account

Description:
This policy setting determines which accounts will not be able to log on to the computer as

that use the Task Scheduler to schedule jobs need this user right.
This user right supersedes the Log on as a batch job user right, which could be used to
allow accounts to schedule jobs that consume excessive system resources. Such an
occurrence could cause a DoS condition. Failure to assign this user right to the
recommended accounts can be a security risk.
The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.
Rationale:
Accounts that have the Log on as a batch job user right could be used to schedule jobs that
could consume excessive computer resources and cause a DoS condition.

Note #2: In all versions of Windows Server prior to Server 2008 R2, Remote Desktop
Services was known as Terminal Services, so you should substitute the older term if
comparing against an older OS.
Rationale:
Any account with the right to log on through Remote Desktop Services could be used to log
on to the remote console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate
users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might
download and run malicious software that elevates their privileges.

2.2.26 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services' is set
to 'Guests, Local account' (MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Remote Desktop clients. After
the baseline Member Server is joined to a domain environment, there is no need to use
local accounts to access the server from the network. Domain accounts can access the
server for administration and end-user processing. This user right supersedes the Allow
log on through Remote Desktop Services user right if an account is subject to both
policies.
The recommended state for this setting is: Guests, Local account.
Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may
result in an inability to remotely administer the server.

Description:
This policy setting allows users to shut down Windows Vista-based and newer computers
from remote locations on the network. Anyone who has been assigned this user right can
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, which would make the computer unavailable to
service user requests. Therefore, it is recommended that only highly trusted administrators

require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow the NT SERVICE\ADFSSrv and
NT SERVICE\DRS services, as well as the associated Active Directory Federation Services
service account, to be granted this user right.
Rationale:
An attacker could use this capability to create a large number of audited events, which
would make it more difficult for a system administrator to locate any illicit activity. Also, if
the event log is configured to overwrite events as needed, any evidence of unauthorized
activities could be overwritten by a large number of unrelated events.

2.2.31 (L1) Ensure 'Impersonate a client after authentication' is set to
'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE' (DC only)
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or
another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is
required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a
client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a
service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the
unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.
Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group
added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM
infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group
added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when
they are started.
Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist:




The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.
The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to
create the access token.
The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.

An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a
service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client
to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK
SERVICE, SERVICE.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Note #2: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server and its optional "Integration

class.) This user right is not required by administrative tools that are supplied with the
operating system but might be required by software development tools.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Window Manager\Window

Windows Vista.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Rationale:
Device drivers run as highly privileged code. A user who has the Load and unload device

Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting allows accounts to log on using the task scheduler service. Because the
task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise
environments. However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to
prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch
malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
The Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability. For most
organizations, the default settings are sufficient.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

132 | P a g e

Impact:
If you configure the Log on as a batch job setting through domain-based Group Policies,
the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for
scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler. If you install optional components such as ASP.NET
or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by
those components. For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the IIS_WPG
group and the IUSR_(ComputerName), ASPNET, and IWAM_(ComputerName) accounts. If this
user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some
COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality.

2.2.42 (L1) Ensure 'Profile single process' is set to 'Administrators'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which users can use tools to monitor the performance of
non-system processes. Typically, you do not need to configure this user right to use the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Performance snap-in. However, you do need this
user right if System Monitor is configured to collect data using Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI). Restricting the Profile single process user right prevents
intruders from gaining additional information that could be used to mount an attack on the
system.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
The Profile single process user right presents a moderate vulnerability. An attacker with
this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes
that they might wish to attack directly. The attacker may also be able to determine what
processes run on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they may
need to avoid, such as antivirus software, an intrusion-detection system, or which other
users are logged on to a computer.

Description:
This policy setting allows users to use tools to view the performance of different system
processes, which could be abused to allow attackers to determine a system's active
processes and provide insight into the potential attack surface of the computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, NT SERVICE\WdiServiceHost.
Rationale:
The Profile system performance user right poses a moderate vulnerability. Attackers
with this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical
processes that they might wish to attack directly. Attackers may also be able to determine
what processes are active on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows one process or service to start another service or process with a
different security access token, which can be used to modify the security access token of
that sub-process and result in the escalation of privileges.
The recommended state for this setting is: LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Note #2: A Member Server that holds the Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Server Role
Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application
pool(s) to be granted this user right.
Note #3: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server installed will require a special
exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this
user right.
Rationale:
Users with the Replace a process level token privilege are able to start processes as other
users whose credentials they know. They could use this method to hide their unauthorized
actions on the computer. (On Windows 2000-based computers, use of the Replace a
process level token user right also requires the user to have the Adjust memory quotas
for a process user right that is discussed earlier in this section.)

2.2.45 (L1) Ensure 'Restore files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other
persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers
that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also determines
which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the Back up
files and directories user right.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Rationale:
An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data
to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important
data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that
are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include
malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install
backdoors for continued access to the computer.
Note: Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore
data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical
that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.

2.2.46 (L1) Ensure 'Shut down the system' is set to 'Administrators'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which users who are logged on locally to the computers in
your environment can shut down the operating system with the Shut Down command.
Misuse of this user right can result in a denial of service condition.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
The ability to shut down Domain Controllers and Member Servers should be limited to a
very small number of trusted Administrators. Although the Shut down the system user
right requires the ability to log on to the server, you should be very careful about which
accounts and groups you allow to shut down a Domain Controller or Member Server.
When a Domain Controller is shut down, it is no longer available to process logons, serve
Group Policy, and answer Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries. If you
shut down Domain Controllers that possess Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO)
roles, you can disable key domain functionality, such as processing logons for new
passwords — one of the functions of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator role.

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This security setting determines which users and groups have the authority to synchronize
all directory service data. This is also known as Active Directory synchronization.
The recommended state for this setting is: No One.
Rationale:
The Synchronize directory service data user right affects Domain Controllers; only
Domain Controllers should be able to synchronize directory service data. Domain
Controllers have this user right inherently, because the synchronization process runs in the
context of the System account on Domain Controllers. Attackers who have this user right
can view all information stored within the directory. They could then use some of that
information to facilitate additional attacks or expose sensitive data, such as direct
telephone numbers or physical addresses.

Description:
This policy setting allows users to take ownership of files, folders, registry keys, processes,
or threads. This user right bypasses any permissions that are in place to protect objects to
give ownership to the specified user.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
Rationale:
Any users with the Take ownership of files or other objects user right can take control of
any object, regardless of the permissions on that object, and then make any changes they
wish to that object. Such changes could result in exposure of data, corruption of data, or a
DoS condition.

2.3.1 Accounts
This section contains recommendations related to default accounts.

2.3.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Administrator account status' is set to
'Disabled' (MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting enables or disables the Administrator account during normal operation.
When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is always enabled,
regardless of how this setting is configured. Note that this setting will have no impact when
applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group policy because Domain
Controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via
group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular
schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to
disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes
to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be
locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for
brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known
security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using
the SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename the
Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log
on.

158 | P a g e

Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Accounts: Administrator account status

Impact:
Maintenance issues can arise under certain circumstances if you disable the Administrator
account. For example, if the secure channel between a member computer and the Domain
Controller fails in a domain environment for any reason and there is no other local
Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that broke the
secure channel.
If the current Administrator password does not meet the password requirements, you will
not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is disabled. If this situation
occurs, another member of the Administrators group must set the password on the
Administrator account with the Local Users and Groups tool.
Default Value:
Disabled.

Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Users can't add or log on with Microsoft
accounts.
Rationale:
Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and
maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably
want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts
in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information
systems.

2.3.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Guest account status' is set to 'Disabled'
(MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The Guest
account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: This setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers
organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account
database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account
lockout and password policy settings.
Rationale:
The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest with no
password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the
Guest account over the network. This capability means that any network shares with
permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone
group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to the exposure or corruption
of data.

2.3.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can
be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable
this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the
network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the
keyboard of the computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden
through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default
settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven
characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domainbased password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a
user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank
passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank
passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected
accounts could then use it to log on.

2.3.1.5 (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename administrator account'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will
target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that
denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default
description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console). On
Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the
built-in Administrator account that was established when the domain was first created.
Rationale:
The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer
operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized
persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.
The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an
attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a
popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this
countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are
third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name.
Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute
force attack by using the SID to log on.

recommended to rename this account to something that does not indicate its purpose. Even
if you disable this account, which is recommended, ensure that you rename it for added
security. On Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule
refers to the built-in Guest account that was established when the domain was first created.

2.3.2 Audit
This section contains recommendations related to auditing controls.

2.3.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings
(Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings' is set
to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities
present in Windows Vista.
The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet
contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the
auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory
settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to
be configured to Enabled.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Important: Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of
traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege
Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find
other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant
impact on system performance.
Rationale:
Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to
track events at a per-system or per-user level. The larger event categories created too
many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find.

2.3.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to
log security audits' is set to 'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security
events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2
and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit
system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the
system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When
this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be
logged for any reason.
If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is
enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be
significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do
not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a
backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of
service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is
overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security
log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the
operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system
guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot
guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the
computer restarts.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important
troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also,
an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely
force a computer shutdown.

This policy setting determines who is allowed to format and eject removable NTFS media.
You can use this policy setting to prevent unauthorized users from removing data on one
computer to access it on another computer on which they have local administrator
privileges.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
Rationale:
Users may be able to move data on removable disks to a different computer where they
have administrative privileges. The user could then take ownership of any file, grant
themselves full control, and view or modify any file. The fact that most removable storage
devices will eject media by pressing a mechanical button diminishes the advantage of this
policy setting.

2.3.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers'
is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be
installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a
printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not
affect Administrators.
Rationale:
It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on
their own workstations. However, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do so
on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may unintentionally cause the
computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer
drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install
malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to
disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if
they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your
computer network.

2.3.5 Domain controller
This section contains recommendations related to Domain Controllers.

2.3.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: Allow server operators to
schedule tasks' is set to 'Disabled' (DC only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting determines whether members of the Server Operators group are
allowed to submit jobs by means of the AT schedule facility. The impact of this policy
setting configuration should be small for most organizations. Users, including those in the
Server Operators group, will still be able to create jobs by means of the Task Scheduler
Wizard, but those jobs will run in the context of the account with which the user
authenticates when they set up the job.
Note: An AT Service Account can be modified to select a different account rather than the
LOCAL SYSTEM account. To change the account, open System Tools, click Scheduled Tasks,
and then click Accessories folder. Then click AT Service Account on the Advanced menu.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
If you enable this policy setting, jobs that are created by server operators by means of the
AT service will execute in the context of the account that runs that service. By default, that
is the local SYSTEM account. If you enable this policy setting, server operators could
perform tasks that SYSTEM is able to do but that they would typically not be able to do,
such as add their account to the local Administrators group.

2.3.5.2 (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: LDAP server signing
requirements' is set to 'Require signing' (DC only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
server requires LDAP clients to negotiate data signing.
The recommended state for this setting is: Require signing.
Note: Domain member computers must have Network security: LDAP signing requirements
(Rule 2.3.11.8) set to Negotiate signing or higher. If not, they will fail to authenticate
once the above Require signing value is configured on the Domain Controllers.
Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration.
Note #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind
(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No
Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple
bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller.
Note #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients
(including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active
Directory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those applications.
Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure LDAP (LDAPS),
or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to identify whether your DCs
are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those accesses are coming from), see
this Microsoft TechNet blog article: Identifying Clear Text LDAP binds to your DC’s –
Practical Windows Security

181 | P a g e

Rationale:
Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an
intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then
forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a
client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower
the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong
physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could
implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which
performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of manin-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.
Additionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received
over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account
passwords by other systems on the network.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters:LDAPServ

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Require
signing:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements

182 | P a g e

Impact:
Unless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. Clients that
do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the Domain
Controllers. All Windows 2000-based computers in your organization that are managed
from Windows Server 2003-based or Windows XP-based computers and that use Windows
NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication must have Windows 2000 Service Pack 3
(SP3) installed. Alternatively, these clients must have a registry change. For information
about this registry change, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 325465: Windows 2000
domain controllers require SP3 or later when using Windows Server 2003 administration
tools. Also, some non-Microsoft operating systems do not support LDAP signing. If you
enable this policy setting, client computers that use those operating systems may be unable
to access domain resources.
Default Value:
None. (Data signing is not required in order to bind with the server. If the client requests
data signing, the server supports it.)

2.3.6 Domain member
This section contains recommendations related to domain membership.

2.3.6.1 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure
channel data (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether all secure channel traffic that is initiated by the
domain member must be signed or encrypted.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain,
the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the
Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the
secure channel are authenticated—and sensitive information such as passwords are
encrypted—but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted.
Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported.
The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the Domain Controller.

channel data (always)

Impact:
None - this is the default behavior. However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a
(SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows operating system support digital
encryption and signing of the secure channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not
support it unless they have Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the Domain
member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting on Domain
Controllers that support Windows 98 clients as members of the domain. Potential impacts
can include the following:




The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients running versions of
Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled.
Logons from clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with
SP6a will be disabled.
The ability to authenticate other domains' users from a Domain Controller running a
version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted domain will
be disabled.

You can enable this policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the
domain and upgrade all Windows NT 4.0 servers and Domain Controllers from
trusted/trusting domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a.

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its
computer account password. Computers that cannot automatically change their account
passwords are potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the
password for the system's domain account.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a
domain is that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts
every 30 days. If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server 2003
will retain the same passwords as their computer accounts. Computers that are no longer
able to automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could
determine the password for the computer's domain account.

Description:
This policy setting determines the maximum allowable age for a computer account

every 30 days.
The recommended state for this setting is: 30 or fewer days, but not 0.
Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables maximum password

Rationale:
In Active Directory-based domains, each computer has an account and password just like
every user. By default, the domain members automatically change their domain password
every 30 days. If you increase this interval significantly, or set it to 0 so that the computers
no longer change their passwords, an attacker will have more time to undertake a brute

Description:
When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with Domain
Controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit)
session key.
To enable this policy setting, all Domain Controllers in the domain must be able to encrypt
secure channel data with a strong key, which means all Domain Controllers must be
running Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between Domain
Controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in
previous Microsoft operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take advantage of
these stronger session keys to help protect secure channel communications from attacks
that attempt to hijack network sessions and eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of
hacking in which network data is read or altered in transit. The data can be modified to
hide or change the sender, or be redirected.)

2.3.7.1 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' is
set to 'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log
on.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical
impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press
CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords.
If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of
a trusted path.
An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows
logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log
on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.

Impact:
Users will have to acknowledge a dialog box containing the configured text before they can
log on to the computer.
Note: Windows Vista and Windows XP Professional support logon banners that can exceed
512 characters in length and that can also contain carriage-return line-feed sequences.
However, Windows 2000-based clients cannot interpret and display these messages. You
must use a Windows 2000-based computer to create a logon message policy that applies to
Windows 2000-based computers.
Default Value:
No message.

2.3.7.6 (L2) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to
cache (in case domain controller is not available)' is set to '4 or fewer
logon(s)' (MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using
cached account information. Logon information for domain accounts can be cached locally
to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted. This policy setting
determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locally. If
this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker who is able to access
the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force
attack to determine user passwords.
The recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s).
Rationale:
The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose
logon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the
computer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the computer,
the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session.
Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that
computer. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could locate
this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user
passwords. To mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and obscures
its physical location.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon:CachedLogonsCount

208 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 4 or
fewer logon(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to
cache (in case domain controller is not available)

Impact:
Users will be unable to log on to any computers if there is no Domain Controller available
to authenticate them. Organizations may want to configure this value to 2 for end-user
computers, especially for mobile users. A configuration value of 2 means that the user's
logon information will still be in the cache, even if a member of the IT department has
recently logged on to their computer to perform system maintenance. This method allows
users to log on to their computers when they are not connected to the organization's
network.
Default Value:
On Windows Server 2008 (non-R2): 25 logons.
On Windows Server 2008 R2 or newer: 10 logons.

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
This policy setting determines how far in advance users are warned that their password
will expire. It is recommended that you configure this policy setting to at least 5 days but
no more than 14 days to sufficiently warn users when their passwords will expire.
The recommended state for this setting is: between 5 and 14 days.
Rationale:
It is recommended that user passwords be configured to expire periodically. Users will
need to be warned that their passwords are going to expire, or they may inadvertently be
locked out of the computer when their passwords expire. This condition could lead to
confusion for users who access the network locally, or make it impossible for users to
access your organization's network through dial-up or virtual private network (VPN)
connections.

2.3.7.8 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller
Authentication to unlock workstation' is set to 'Enabled' (MS only)
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
Logon information is required to unlock a locked computer. For domain accounts, this
security setting determines whether it is necessary to contact a Domain Controller to
unlock a computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
By default, the computer caches in memory the credentials of any users who are
authenticated locally. The computer uses these cached credentials to authenticate anyone
who attempts to unlock the console. When cached credentials are used, any changes that
have recently been made to the account — such as user rights assignments, account
lockout, or the account being disabled — are not considered or applied after the account is
authenticated. User privileges are not updated, and (more importantly) disabled accounts
are still able to unlock the console of the computer.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows

Impact:
When the console on a computer is locked, either by a user or automatically by a screen
saver time-out, the console can only be unlocked if a Domain Controller is available to reauthenticate the domain account that is being used to unlock the computer. If no Domain
Controller is available, the user cannot unlock the computer.
Default Value:
Disabled. (Logon information confirmation with a Domain Controller is not required for a
user to unlock the computer, and the user can unlock the computer using cached
credentials, if they are present.)

2.3.7.9 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior' is
set to 'Lock Workstation' or higher (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is
removed from the smart card reader.
The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation. Configuring this setting to
Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to
the benchmark.
Rationale:
Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing
the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for
authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to
ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those
credentials.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed, noting that values of Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop
Services session are also acceptable settings. This group policy setting is backed by the
following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon:ScRemoveOption

214 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Lock
Workstation (or, if applicable for your environment, Force Logoff or Disconnect if a
Remote Desktop Services session):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior

Impact:
If you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed,
allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a
protected session.
If you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is
removed.
If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart
card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the
smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped
computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function
identically to Lock Workstation.
Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers
in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if
network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several
computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting
will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these reasons it is
recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes
commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and email.
Default Value:
No action.

2.3.8 Microsoft network client
This section contains recommendations related to configuring the Microsoft network client.

2.3.8.1 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign
communications (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client
component.
Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they
connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is
synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign
communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings,
see the "Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related
settings)" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker
could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized
access to data.
SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating
systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate
both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process,
data transmission will not take place.

Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parame

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network client: Digitally sign
communications (always)

Impact:
The Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless
that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing.
The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows
XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing
protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and
supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then
verified by both the client and the server.
Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet
needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing
multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file
server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed.
Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older
applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely
disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.
When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server
2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group
policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see
Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy settings are not

required before suspending session' is set to '15 or fewer minute(s)'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to specify the amount of continuous idle time that must pass
in an SMB session before the session is suspended because of inactivity. Administrators can
use this policy setting to control when a computer suspends an inactive SMB session. If
client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished.
The maximum value is 99999, which is over 69 days; in effect, this value disables the
setting.
The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or fewer minute(s).
Rationale:
Each SMB session consumes server resources, and numerous null sessions will slow the
server or possibly cause it to fail. An attacker could repeatedly establish SMB sessions until
the server's SMB services become slow or unresponsive.

2.3.9.4 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Disconnect clients when
logon hours expire' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This security setting determines whether to disconnect users who are connected to the
local computer outside their user account's valid logon hours. This setting affects the
Server Message Block (SMB) component. If you enable this policy setting you should also
enable Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire (Rule 2.3.11.6).
If your organization configures logon hours for users, this policy setting is necessary to
ensure they are effective.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
If your organization configures logon hours for users, then it makes sense to enable this
policy setting. Otherwise, users who should not have access to network resources outside
of their logon hours may actually be able to continue to use those resources with sessions
that were established during allowed hours.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters:
enableforcedlogoff

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network server: Disconnect clients when
logon hours expire

233 | P a g e

Impact:
None - this is the default behavior. If logon hours are not used in your organization, this
policy setting will have no impact. If logon hours are used, existing user sessions will be
forcibly terminated when their logon hours expire.
Default Value:
Enabled. (Client sessions with the SMB service are forcibly disconnected when the client's
logon hours expire.)

2.3.9.5 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Server SPN target name
validation level' is set to 'Accept if provided by client' or higher (MS only)
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls the level of validation a computer with shared folders or
printers (the server) performs on the service principal name (SPN) that is provided by the
client computer when it establishes a session using the server message block (SMB)
protocol.
The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for file and print sharing and
other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. The SMB protocol
supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the authentication
blob provided by a SMB client to prevent a class of attacks against SMB servers referred to
as SMB relay attacks. This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2.
The recommended state for this setting is: Accept if provided by client. Configuring
this setting to Required from client also conforms to the benchmark.
Note: Since the release of the MS KB3161561 security patch, this setting can cause
significant issues (such as replication problems, group policy editing issues and blue screen
crashes) on Domain Controllers when used simultaneously with UNC path hardening (i.e.
Rule 18.5.14.1). CIS therefore recommends against deploying this setting on Domain
Controllers.
Rationale:
The identity of a computer can be spoofed to gain unauthorized access to network
resources.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters:
SMBServerNameHardeningLevel

235 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Accept if
provided by client (configuring to Required from client also conforms to the
benchmark):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network server: Server SPN target name
validation level

Impact:
All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a serverside SMB component. This setting affects the server SMB behavior, and its implementation
should be carefully evaluated and tested to prevent disruptions to file and print serving
capabilities.
If configured to Accept if provided by client, the SMB server will accept and validate
the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it matches the
SMB server’s list of SPN’s for itself. If the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that
SMB client will be denied.
If configured to Required from client, the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session
setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being requested to
establish a connection. If no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN provided does not match,
the session is denied.
Default Value:
Off. (The SPN is not required or validated by the SMB server from a SMB client.)

2.3.10.1 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Allow anonymous SID/Name
translation' is set to 'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether an anonymous user can request security identifier
(SID) attributes for another user, or use a SID to obtain its corresponding user name.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
If this policy setting is enabled, a user with local access could use the well-known
Administrator's SID to learn the real name of the built-in Administrator account, even if it
has been renamed. That person could then use the account name to initiate a password
guessing attack.

2.3.10.2 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Do not allow anonymous
enumeration of SAM accounts' is set to 'Enabled' (MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate the accounts in
the Security Accounts Manager (SAM). If you enable this policy setting, users with
anonymous connections will not be able to enumerate domain account user names on the
systems in your environment. This policy setting also allows additional restrictions on
anonymous connections.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.
Rationale:
An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and use the information to
attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks. (Social engineering
attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some form of security
information.)
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa:RestrictAnonymousSAM

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration

239 | P a g e

Impact:
None - this is the default behavior. It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows
NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client computers that run older versions of the Windows
operating system such as Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems
when they try to use resources on the server.
Default Value:

(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate SAM accounts as
well as shares. If you enable this policy setting, anonymous users will not be able to
enumerate domain account user names and network share names on the systems in your
environment.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.
Rationale:
An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and shared resources and use
the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks.
(Social engineering attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some
form of security information.)

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration
of SAM accounts and shares

241 | P a g e

Impact:
It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client
computers that run older versions of the Windows operating system such as Windows NT
3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems when they try to use resources on the
server. Users who access file and print servers anonymously will be unable to list the
shared network resources on those servers; the users will have to authenticate before they
can view the lists of shared folders and printers. However, even with this policy setting
enabled, anonymous users will have access to resources with permissions that explicitly
include the built-in group, ANONYMOUS LOGON.
Default Value:
Disabled. (Allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares. No additional
permissions can be assigned by the administrator for anonymous connections to the
computer. Anonymous connections will rely on default permissions.)

'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether Credential Manager (formerly called Stored User
Names and Passwords) saves passwords or credentials for later use when it gains domain
authentication.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: Changes to this setting will not take effect until Windows is restarted.
Rationale:
Passwords that are cached can be accessed by the user when logged on to the computer.
Although this information may sound obvious, a problem can arise if the user unknowingly
executes hostile code that reads the passwords and forwards them to another,
unauthorized user.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords
and credentials for network authentication

243 | P a g e

Impact:
Credential Manager will not store passwords and credentials on the computer. Users will
be forced to enter passwords whenever they log on to their Passport account or other
network resources that aren't accessible to their domain account. Testing has shown that
clients running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 will be unable to connect to
Distributed File System (DFS) shares in untrusted domains. Enabling this setting also
makes it impossible to specify alternate credentials for scheduled tasks, this can cause a
variety of problems. For example, some third party backup products will no longer work.
This policy setting should have no impact on users who access network resources that are
configured to allow access with their Active Directory-based domain account.
Default Value:
Disabled. (Credential Manager will store passwords and credentials on the computer for
later use for domain authentication.)

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines which registry paths will be accessible over the network,
regardless of the users or groups listed in the access control list (ACL) of the winreg
registry key.
Note: This setting does not exist in Windows XP. There was a setting with that name in
Windows XP, but it is called "Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and subpaths" in Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 (non-R2).
Note #2: When you configure this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The
delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the first
object on the list, press the Enter button, type the next object, press Enter again, etc. The
setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in group policy security templates. It is
also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group Policy Editor's display pane and the
Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the registry as a line-feed delimited list in a
REG_MULTI_SZ value.
The recommended state for this setting is:
System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions
System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Server Applications
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion

Rationale:
The registry is a database that contains computer configuration information, and much of
the information is sensitive. An attacker could use this information to facilitate
unauthorized activities. To reduce the risk of such an attack, suitable ACLs are assigned
throughout the registry to help protect it from access by unauthorized users.

Description:
This policy setting determines which network shares can be accessed by anonymous users.
The default configuration for this policy setting has little effect because all users have to be

local accounts' is set to 'Classic - local users authenticate as themselves'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are
authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including
the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The
Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate
as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.
The recommended state for this setting is: Classic - local users authenticate as
themselves.
Note: This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using
such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services).
Rationale:
With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the
network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write
access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase
security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those
computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for
the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected.
Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared
system resources.

2.3.11 Network security
This section contains recommendations related to network security.

2.3.11.1 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Allow Local System to use
computer identity for NTLM' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether Local System services that use Negotiate when
reverting to NTLM authentication can use the computer identity. This policy is supported
on at least Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista
or Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), services running as Local System and using SPNEGO
(Negotiate) that revert to NTLM use the computer identity. In Windows 7, if you are
connecting to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, then a system
service uses either the computer identity or a NULL session. When connecting with a NULL
session, a system-generated session key is created, which provides no protection but
allows applications to sign and encrypt data without errors. When connecting with the
computer identity, both signing and encryption is supported in order to provide data
protection.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:

Impact:
Services running as Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM
authentication will use the computer identity. This might cause some authentication
requests between Windows operating systems to fail and log an error.
Default Value:
Disabled. (Services running as Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM
authentication will authenticate anonymously.)

2.3.11.3 (L1) Ensure 'Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication
requests to this computer to use online identities' is set to 'Disabled'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.
The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider
(SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7
media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between
computers that are not members of a domain.
With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,
Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos
or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is
treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including
PKU2U.
When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,
Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP
obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When
validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer
for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process
completes.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be
managed centrally in most managed networks.

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new
password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and
prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash.
Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can
then be easily compromised if the database is attacked.
Note: Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy
setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts
after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password
hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to
impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network. These types of attacks
will not be prevented if you enable this policy setting, but it will be much more difficult for
these types of attacks to succeed.

2.3.11.7 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication
level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating
Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network.
LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features,
and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is
the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for
some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication
includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is
used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:






Join a domain
Authenticate between Active Directory forests
Authenticate to down-level domains
Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
or Windows XP
Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain

The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which
challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects
the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated,
and the level of authentication accepted by servers.
The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM &
NTLM.

277 | P a g e

Rationale:
Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM
authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send
LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (nonR2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this
meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over
the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily
reproduce the user's password.
The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the
Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003
domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for
network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process,
NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use
NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are
members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with
Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly
preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa:LmCompatibilityLevel

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Send
NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network security: LAN Manager authentication level

Impact:
Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server
supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2
authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to
authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.

278 | P a g e

Default Value:
Send NTLMv2 response only. (Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2
session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers accept LM, NTLM & NTLMv2
authentication.)

2.3.11.8 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LDAP client signing
requirements' is set to 'Negotiate signing' or higher (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients
that issue LDAP BIND requests.
Note: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind
(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No
Microsoft LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use
ldap_simple_bind or ldap_simple_bind_s to communicate with a Domain Controller.
The recommended state for this setting is: Negotiate signing. Configuring this setting to
Require signing also conforms to the benchmark.
Rationale:
Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder
captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them
to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a
server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To
lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to
protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle
attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means
of IPsec authentication headers.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LDAP:LDAPClientIntegrity

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Negotiate
signing (configuring to Require signing also conforms to the benchmark):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network security: LDAP client signing requirements

Impact:
None - this is the default behavior. However, if you choose instead to configure the server
to require LDAP signatures then you must also configure the client. If you do not configure
the client it will not be able to communicate with the server, which could cause many
features to fail, including user authentication, Group Policy, and logon scripts, because the
caller will be told that the LDAP BIND command request failed.
Default Value:
Negotiate signing. (If Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) has not
been started, the LDAP BIND request is initiated with the LDAP data signing option set in
addition to the caller-specified options. If TLS/SSL has been started, the LDAP BIND
request is initiated with the caller-specified options.)

2.3.13 Shutdown
This section contains recommendations related to the Windows shutdown functionality.

2.3.13.1 (L1) Ensure 'Shutdown: Allow system to be shut down without
having to log on' is set to 'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether a computer can be shut down when a user is not
logged on. If this policy setting is enabled, the shutdown command is available on the
Windows logon screen. It is recommended to disable this policy setting to restrict the
ability to shut down the computer to users with credentials on the system.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: In Server 2008 R2 and older versions, this setting had no impact on Remote Desktop
(RDP) / Terminal Services sessions - it only affected the local console. However, Microsoft
changed the behavior in Windows Server 2012 (non-R2) and above, where if set to
Enabled, RDP sessions are also allowed to shut down or restart the server.
Rationale:
Users who can access the console locally could shut down the computer. Attackers could
also walk to the local console and restart the server, which would cause a temporary DoS
condition. Attackers could also shut down the server and leave all of its applications and
services unavailable. As noted in the Description above, the Denial of Service (DoS) risk of
enabling this setting dramatically increases in Windows Server 2012 (non-R2) and above,
as even remote users could then shut down or restart the server from the logon screen of
an RDP session.

2.3.15 System objects
This section contains recommendations related to system objects.

2.3.15.1 (L1) Ensure 'System objects: Require case insensitivity for nonWindows subsystems' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems.
The Microsoft Win32 subsystem is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case
sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX
(POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will support case
sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a user of the POSIX
subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by using mixed case to label
it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32
tools, because only one of the files will be available.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity,
failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that subsystem to
create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of upper and lower
case letters. Such a situation could potentially confuse users when they try to access such
files from normal Win32 tools because only one of the files will be available.

Description:
This policy setting determines the strength of the default discretionary access control list
(DACL) for objects. Active Directory maintains a global list of shared system resources,
such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. In this way, objects can be located
and shared among processes. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that
specifies who can access the objects and what permissions are granted.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
This setting determines the strength of the default DACL for objects. Windows maintains a

2.3.17 User Account Control
This section contains recommendations related to User Account Control.

2.3.17.1 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for
the Built-in Administrator account' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in
Administrator account.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is
trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without
the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs
was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user
account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista
and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default
installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are
initially set up in one of two ways:



If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the
equivalent permissions as a local administrator.
If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created.
The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create
one if a local administrator account is warranted.

Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled,
but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.

Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators.
The recommended state for this setting is: Prompt for consent on the secure desktop.
Rationale:
One of the risks that the UAC feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is
that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or
administrator being aware of its activity. This setting raises awareness to the administrator
of elevated privilege operations and permits the administrator to prevent a malicious

Description:
This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users.
The recommended state for this setting is: Automatically deny elevation requests.
Rationale:
One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is
trying to mitigate is that of malicious programs running under elevated credentials without
the user or administrator being aware of their activity. This setting raises awareness to the
user that a program requires the use of elevated privilege operations and requires that the
user be able to supply administrative credentials in order for the program to run.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System:

Automatically deny elevation requests:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation
prompt for standard users

296 | P a g e

Impact:
When an operation requires elevation of privilege, a configurable access denied error
message is displayed. An enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may choose
this setting to reduce help desk calls.
Note: With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message displayed
when a user attempts to perform an operation or run a program requiring privilege
elevation (without Administrator rights) is "This program will not run. This program is
blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator." Some
users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that the operation or program
they attempted to run is specifically blocked by group policy, as that is what the message
seems to imply. This message may therefore result in user questions as to why that specific
operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the problem is that they need to perform the
operation or run the program with an Administrative account (or "Run as Administrator" if
it is already an Administrator account), and they are not doing that.
Default Value:
Prompt for credentials. (When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is
prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user enters valid
credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.)

Description:
This policy setting controls the behavior of application installation detection for the

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Some malicious software will attempt to install itself after being given permission to run.
For example, malicious software with a trusted application shell. The user may have given
permission for the program to run because the program is trusted, but if they are then

2.3.17.5 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess
applications that are installed in secure locations' is set to 'Enabled'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface
Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system.
Secure locations are limited to the following:




…\Program Files\, including subfolders
…\Windows\System32\
…\Program Files (x86)\, including subfolders (for 64-bit versions of Windows)

Note: Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any
interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of the
state of this security setting.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI)
restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an
administrator. This is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers that
are transmitting user interfaces to alternative forms. A process that is started with
UIAccess rights has the following abilities:






To set the foreground window.
To drive any application window using SendInput function.
To use read input for all integrity levels using low-level hooks, raw input,
GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInput.
To set journal hooks.
To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity input queue.

Rationale:
Standard elevation prompt dialog boxes can be spoofed, which may cause users to disclose
their passwords to malicious software. The secure desktop presents a very distinct
appearance when prompting for elevation, where the user desktop dims, and the elevation
prompt UI is more prominent. This increases the likelihood that users who become

Description:
Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications to
the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.
The recommended state for this setting is: No.
Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No, it's
recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No. Otherwise,
users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted
inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

9.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Private: Outbound connections' is

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an
outbound firewall rule.
The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).
Note: If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using
a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy
updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work.
Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to
work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles
before deploying.
Rationale:
Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those
specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion,
blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of
dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser
or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value
because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
anyway.

This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an
outbound firewall rule.
The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).
Note: If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using
a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy
updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work.
Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to
work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles
before deploying.
Rationale:
Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those
specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion,
blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of
dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser
or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value
because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall
anyway.

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:

Description:
This subcategory reports the results of validation tests on credentials submitted for a user
account logon request. These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the
credentials. For domain accounts, the Domain Controller is authoritative, whereas for local
accounts, the local computer is authoritative. In domain environments, most of the Account
Logon events occur in the Security log of the Domain Controllers that are authoritative for
the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on other computers in the
organization when local accounts are used to log on. Events for this subcategory include:


6.2 Ensure Audit Log Settings Support Appropriate Log Entry Formatting
Validate audit log settings for each hardware device and the software installed on it,
ensuring that logs include a date, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and
various other useful elements of each packet and/or transaction. Systems should record
logs in a standardized format such as syslog entries or those outlined by the Common Event
Expression initiative. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, log
normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format.

17.6.4 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Removable Storage' is set to 'Success and
Failure' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a
removable storage device. A security audit event is generated only for all objects for all
types of access requested. If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated
each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. Success audits
record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not
configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file
system object on a removable storage.
The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.
Note: A Windows 8.0, Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer OS is required to access and set this
value in Group Policy.
Rationale:
Auditing removable storage may be useful when investigating an incident. For example, if
an individual is suspected of copying sensitive information onto a USB drive.

Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive
system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered.
The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes;
highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration
changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in
account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These
integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and
permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could
be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system
areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files
inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).

4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this
problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being
modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote
computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also
indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem
persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound
packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured.
This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without
informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security
Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is
corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the
remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may
also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that
case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.
5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec
Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the
computer to potential security risks.
5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the
computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network
interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the
IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

Impact:
If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

18.2 LAPS
This section contains recommendations for configuring Microsoft Local Administrator
Password Solution (LAPS).
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template AdmPwd.admx/adml that
is included with LAPS.

18.2.1 (L1) Ensure LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE is installed (MS
only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool,
which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set
randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached
workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of
the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved
Sysadmins when needed.
The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as
well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.
Please see the LAPS documentation for details.
LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer
server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a
domain.
Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique &
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.
Note #2: LAPS is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is therefore
not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not
have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy
the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.

438 | P a g e

Rationale:
Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when
deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker
manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator
account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers
that also use that password for their local Administrator account.
Audit:
The LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE can be verified to be installed by the presence of
the following registry value:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GPExtensions\{D76B9641-3288-4f75-942D087DE603E3EA}:DllName

Remediation:
In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is required, and a Group
Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be installed on each managed computer. When
LAPS is installed, the file AdmPwd.dll must be present in the following location and
registered in Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for
you):
C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll

Impact:
No impact. When installed and registered properly, AdmPwd.dll takes no action unless
given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a memory-resident
agent or service.
In a disaster recovery scenario where Active Directory is not available, the local
Administrator password will not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool
(such as Microsoft's Disaster and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be
necessary.
Default Value:
Not Installed.

18.3 MS Security Guide
This section contains settings for configuring additional settings from the MS Security
Guide.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template SecGuide.admx/adml
that is available from Microsoft at this link.

18.3.1 (L1) Ensure 'Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network
logons' is set to 'Enabled' (MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting controls whether local accounts can be used for remote administration via
network logon (e.g., NET USE, connecting to C$, etc.). Local accounts are at high risk for
credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems.
Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.
Enabled: Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in
powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed
from the resulting access token. This configures the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
registry value to 0. This is the default behavior for Windows.
Disabled: Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via
network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 1.
For more information about local accounts and credential theft, review the "Mitigating
Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques" documents.
For more information about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, see Microsoft Knowledge
Base article 951016: Description of User Account Control and remote restrictions in
Windows Vista.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

454 | P a g e

Rationale:
Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is
configured on multiple systems. Ensuring this policy is Enabled significantly reduces that
risk.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:

18.3.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure SMB v1 client driver' is set to 'Enabled:
Disable driver (recommended)' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting configures the start type for the Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) client
driver service (MRxSmb10), which is recommended to be disabled.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable driver (recommended).
Note: Do not, under any circumstances, configure this overall setting as Disabled, as doing
so will delete the underlying registry entry altogether, which will cause serious problems.
Rationale:
Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no
longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable
to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.

18.3.4 (L1) Ensure 'Enable Structured Exception Handling Overwrite
Protection (SEHOP)' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
Windows includes support for Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection
(SEHOP). We recommend enabling this feature to improve the security profile of the
computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler (SEH)
overwrite technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time. Therefore, it
helps protect applications regardless of whether they have been compiled with the latest
improvements, such as the /SAFESEH option.

18.3.5 (L1) Ensure 'Extended Protection for LDAP Authentication
(Domain Controllers only)' is set to 'Enabled: Enabled, always
(recommended)' (DC Only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Description:
This setting controls LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS to help make it more secure.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended).
Note: All LDAP clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to be compatible
with Domain Controllers that have this setting enabled.
More information on this setting is available at: Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding
registry entry to make LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure
Rationale:
Configuring the LdapEnforceChannelBinding registry value can help to increase protection
against "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters:LdapEnfo
rceChannelBinding

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Enabled, always (recommended):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\MS Security
Guide\Extended Protection for LDAP Authentication (Domain Controllers only)

Note: This Group Policy path does not exist by default. An additional Group Policy template
(SecGuide.admx/adml) is required - it is available from Microsoft at this link.

463 | P a g e

Impact:
All LDAP clients must provide channel binding information. The server rejects
authentication requests from clients that do not do so. Clients must have the CVC-20178563 security update to support this feature, and may have compatibility issues with
Domain Controllers without the security update. This may also mean that LDAP
authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously worked may stop working until the
security update is installed.
When first deploying this setting, you may initially want to only set it to the alternate
setting of Enabled: Enabled, when supported (instead of Enabled: Enabled, always
(recommended)) on all Domain Controllers. This alternate, interim setting enables support
for LDAP client channel binding but does not require it. Then set one DC that is not
currently being targeted by LDAP clients to Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended),
and test each of the critical LDAP clients against that DC (and remediating as necessary),
before deploying Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended) to the rest of the DCs.
Older OSes such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows
Server 2008 (non-R2), will first require patches for Microsoft Security Advisory 973811, as
well as all associated fixes, in order to be compatible with domain controllers that have this
setting deployed.
Note: Only Enabled: Enabled, always (recommended) is actually considered compliant to
the CIS benchmark.
More information on this setting is available at: Use the LdapEnforceChannelBinding
registry entry to make LDAP authentication over SSL-TLS more secure
Default Value:
Disabled. (No LDAP channel binding validation is performed.)

Description:
When WDigest authentication is enabled, Lsass.exe retains a copy of the user's plaintext
password in memory, where it can be at risk of theft. If this setting is not configured,
WDigest authentication is disabled in Windows 8.1 and in Windows Server 2012 R2; it is
enabled by default in earlier versions of Windows and Windows Server.

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting is separate from the Welcome screen feature in Windows XP and Windows
Vista; if that feature is disabled, this setting is not disabled. If you configure a computer for
automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to the computer can also gain
access to everything that is on the computer, including any network or networks to which
the computer is connected. Also, if you enable automatic logon, the password is stored in
the registry in plaintext, and the specific registry key that stores this value is remotely
readable by the Authenticated Users group.
For additional information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 324737: How to turn on

Description:
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects cause the IPv4 stack to plumb host
routes. These routes override the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) generated routes.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
This behavior is expected. The problem is that the 10 minute time-out period for the ICMP
redirect-plumbed routes temporarily creates a network situation in which traffic will no
longer be routed properly for the affected host. Ignoring such ICMP redirects will limit the
system's exposure to attacks that will impact its ability to participate on the network.

Impact:
When Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is configured as an autonomous system

Instead, this router injects host routes into the OSPF routes. However, the OSPF router
cannot be used as an ASBR router, and when connected interface subnet routes are
imported into OSPF the result is confusing routing tables with strange routing paths.

18.4.6 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the
computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS
servers' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to
easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP
addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the
computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to
spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user
who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the
protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the
computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.
An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its
NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that
you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production
environment.
The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target
computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET
SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

Description:
The DLL search order can be configured to search for DLLs that are requested by running
processes in one of two ways:



Search folders specified in the system path first, and then search the current
working folder.
Search current working folder first, and then search the folders specified in the
system path.

When enabled, the registry value is set to 1. With a setting of 1, the system first searches
the folders that are specified in the system path and then searches the current working
folder. When disabled the registry value is set to 0 and the system first searches the current
working folder and then searches the folders that are specified in the system path.
Applications will be forced to search for DLLs in the system path first. For applications that
require unique versions of these DLLs that are included with the application, this entry
could cause performance or stability problems.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: More information on how Safe DLL search mode works is available at this link:
Dynamic-Link Library Search Order - Windows applications | Microsoft Docs
Rationale:
If a user unknowingly executes hostile code that was packaged with additional files that
include modified versions of system DLLs, the hostile code could load its own versions of
those DLLs and potentially increase the type and degree of damage the code can render.

18.5.4.1 (L1) Set 'NetBIOS node type' to 'P-node' (Ensure NetBT
Parameter 'NodeType' is set to '0x2 (2)') (MS Only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This parameter determines which method NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) will use to
register and resolve names.





A B-node (broadcast) system only uses broadcasts.
A P-node (point-to-point) system uses only name queries to a name server (WINS).
An M-node (mixed) system broadcasts first, then queries the name server (WINS).
An H-node (hybrid) system queries the name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts.

The recommended state for this setting is: NodeType - 0x2 (2) (P-node / point-to-point).
Rationale:
In order to help mitigate the risk of NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning attacks,
setting the node type to P-node will prevent the system from sending out NetBIOS
broadcasts.
Audit:
Navigate to the Registry path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

492 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0x2 (2)
(DWORD):
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetBT\Parameters:NodeTyp
e

Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.
Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry
value, a custom .ADM template (Set-NetBIOS-node-type-KB160177.adm) is provided in the
CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply
turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not "undo" the change once
applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the
opposite state.
Impact:
NetBIOS name resolution queries will require a defined and available WINS server for
external NetBIOS name resolution. If a WINS server is not defined or not reachable, and the
desired hostname is not defined in the local cache, local LMHOSTS or HOSTS files, NetBIOS
name resolution will fail.
Default Value:
B-node (broadcast only) if a WINS server is not configured in NIC properties.
H-node (hybrid - point-to-point first, then broadcast) if a WINS server is configured in NIC
properties.

18.5.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off multicast name resolution' is set to
'Enabled' (MS Only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
LLMNR is a secondary name resolution protocol. With LLMNR, queries are sent using
multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another
client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabled. LLMNR does not require
a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in scenarios in
which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS (UDP/137)
broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows the location
of the requested system.
Note: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting,
the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP
(on the WINS tab in the NIC properties). Unfortunately, there is no global setting to achieve
this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per-NIC setting that varies with different
NIC hardware installations.

Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
You can use this procedure to controls user's ability to install and configure a Network
Bridge.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

507 | P a g e

Rationale:
The Network Bridge setting, if enabled, allows users to create a Layer 2 Media Access
Control (MAC) bridge, enabling them to connect two or more physical network segments
together. A Network Bridge thus allows a computer that has connections to two different
networks to share data between those networks.
In an enterprise managed environment, where there is a need to control network traffic to
only authorized paths, allowing users to create a Network Bridge increases the risk and
attack surface from the bridged network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled, with "Require Mutual
Authentication" and "Require Integrity" set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL
shares.

Note: If the environment exclusively contains Windows 8.0 / Server 2012 (non-R2) or
newer systems, then the "Privacy" setting may (optionally) also be set to enable SMB
encryption. However, using SMB encryption will render the targeted share paths
completely inaccessible by older OSes, so only use this additional option with caution and
thorough testing.

514 | P a g e

Rationale:
In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk
in Group Policy as part of the MS15-011 / MSKB 3000483 security update. This mechanism
requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of
specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server
2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not
released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (NetworkProvider.admx/adml)
was also provided with the security update.
Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to
remediate the Group Policy security risk:
\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1
\\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

Note: A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the
above paths.
Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the
Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here: Guidance on
Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014.

18.5.19.2.1 (L2) Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter
'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)') (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange
information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many
more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating
systems may not support IPv6 natively.
The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)
518 | P a g e

Rationale:
Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize
IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components
removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result,
we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.
Audit:
Navigate to the Registry path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff
(255) (DWORD):
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:Disabl
edComponents

Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.
Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry
value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in
the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that
simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not "undo" the change
once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to
the opposite state.
Impact:
Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends
on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6
include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.
This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How to
disable IPv6 or its components in Windows.
Note: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.
Default Value:
All IPv6 components are enabled and Windows prefers IPv6 over IPv4.

18.8.4 Credentials Delegation
This section contains settings related to Credential Delegation.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template CredSsp.admx/adml
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

18.8.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Encryption Oracle Remediation' is set to 'Enabled:
Force Updated Clients' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
Some versions of the CredSSP protocol that is used by some applications (such as Remote
Desktop Connection) are vulnerable to an encryption oracle attack against the client. This
policy controls compatibility with vulnerable clients and servers and allows you to set the
level of protection desired for the encryption oracle vulnerability.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Force Updated Clients.
Rationale:
This setting is important to mitigate the CredSSP encryption oracle vulnerability, for which
information was published by Microsoft on 03/13/2018 in CVE-2018-0886 | CredSSP
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. All versions of Windows Server from Server 2008
(non-R2) onwards are affected by this vulnerability, and will be compatible with this
recommendation provided that they have been patched up through May 2018 (or later).
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\
CredSSP\Parameters:AllowEncryptionOracle

535 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Force Updated Clients:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\System\Credentials
Delegation\Encryption Oracle Remediation

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy
template CredSsp.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1803
Administrative Templates (or newer).
Impact:
Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure versions
and services using CredSSP will not accept unpatched clients. This setting should not be
deployed until all remote hosts support the newest version, which is achieved by ensuring
that all Microsoft security updates at least through May 2018 are installed.
Default Value:
Without the May 2018 security update: Enabled: Vulnerable (Client applications which use
CredSSP will expose the remote servers to attacks by supporting fall back to the insecure
versions and services using CredSSP will accept unpatched clients.)
With the May 2018 security update: Enabled: Mitigated (Client applications which use
CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure version but services using CredSSP will
accept unpatched clients.)

18.8.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable
credentials' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials. When using credential
delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This
exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host. The
Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are two
options to help protect against this risk.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: More detailed information on Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and how
it compares to Restricted Admin Mode can be found at this link: Protect Remote Desktop
credentials with Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft
Docs
Rationale:
Restricted Admin Mode was designed to help protect administrator accounts by ensuring
that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that could
potentially be compromised. Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard helps you protect
your credentials over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting Kerberos requests back
to the device that is requesting the connection. Both features should be enabled and
supported, as they reduce the chance of credential theft.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:

This section contains Device Guard settings.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template
DeviceGuard.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 RTM (Release
1507) Administrative Templates (or newer).

18.8.5.1 (NG) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security' is set to
'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Next Generation Windows Security - Domain Controller
Next Generation Windows Security - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security is enabled. Virtualization
Based Security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled
Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot
enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS
configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual
machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be
exposed by the host to the guest VM.
More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at this link:
Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs
Rationale:
Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based
security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority
(LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its
process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in
the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores
and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using
virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system.

18.8.22.1.13 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off Windows Error Reporting' is set to
'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls whether or not errors are reported to Microsoft.
Error Reporting is used to report information about a system or application that has failed
or has stopped responding and is used to improve the quality of the product.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error should
be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no benefit to
the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some risk of
unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error

18.8.25.1 (L2) Ensure 'Support device authentication using certificate' is
set to 'Enabled: Automatic' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to set support for Kerberos to attempt authentication using
the certificate for the device to the domain.
Support for device authentication using certificate will require connectivity to a DC in the
device account domain which supports certificate authentication for computer accounts.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Automatic.
Rationale:
Having stronger device authentication with the use of certificates is strongly encouraged
over standard username and password authentication. Having this set to Automatic will
allow certificate based authentication to be used whenever possible.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1809 and Server 2019
Administrative Templates (or newer).

18.8.26.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enumeration policy for external devices
incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection' is set to 'Enabled: Block All'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy is intended to provide additional security against external DMA-capable
devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA-capable devices
that are not compatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and sandboxing.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block All.
Note: This policy does not apply to 1394, PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices. The protection
also only applies to Windows 10 R1803 or higher, and also requires a UEFI BIOS to
function.
Note #2: More information on this feature is available at this link: Kernel DMA Protection
for Thunderbolt™ 3 (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs.
Rationale:
Device memory sandboxing allows the OS to leverage the I/O Memory Management Unit
(IOMMU) of a device to block unpermitted I/O, or memory access, by the peripheral.

Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy
template DmaGuard.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release
1809 & Server 2019 Administrative Templates (or newer).
Impact:
External devices that are not compatible with DMA-remapping will not be enumerated and
will not function unless/until the user has logged in successfully and has an unlocked user
session. Once enumerated, these devices will continue to function, regardless of the state of
the session. Devices that are compatible with DMA-remapping will be enumerated
immediately, with their device memory isolated.
Default Value:
Windows Server 2019 and newer: Enabled if UEFI BIOS is present. Disabled if using legacy
BIOS.
Older OSes: Not supported (i.e. Disabled).

Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy prevents automatic copying of user input methods to the system account for use
on the sign-in screen. The user is restricted to the set of input methods that are enabled in

Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy prevents the user from showing account details (email address or user name)
on the sign-in screen.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that
information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as guessing

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:
This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a picture
password.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: If the picture password feature is permitted, the user's domain password is cached in
the system vault when using it.
Rationale:
Picture passwords bypass the requirement for a typed complex password. In a shared work
environment, a simple shoulder surf where someone observed the on-screen gestures
would allow that person to gain access to the system without the need to know the complex
password. Vertical monitor screens with an image are much more visible at a distance than
horizontal key strokes, increasing the likelihood of a successful observation of the mouse
gestures.

This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a
convenience PIN. In Windows 10, convenience PIN was replaced with Passport, which has
stronger security properties. To configure Passport for domain users, use the policies

Components\Microsoft Passport for Work.
Note: The user's domain password will be cached in the system vault when using this

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls whether RPC clients authenticate with the Endpoint Mapper
Service when the call they are making contains authentication information. The Endpoint
Mapper Service on computers running Windows NT4 (all service packs) cannot process
authentication information supplied in this manner. This policy setting can cause a specific
issue with 1-way forest trusts if it is applied to the trusting domain DCs (see Microsoft
KB3073942), so we do not recommend applying it to Domain Controllers.
Note: This policy will not be in effect until the system is rebooted.

18.8.37.2 (L2) Ensure 'Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients' is set to
'Enabled: Authenticated' (MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC
clients connecting to RPC servers.
This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy
setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including
group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual
intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should never be applied to a
Domain Controller.
A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate
with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to
be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on
the selected value for this policy setting.
-- "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which
the policy setting is applied.
-- "Authenticated" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to
connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.
Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.
-- "Authenticated without exceptions" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the
definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy
setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause
serious problems and is not recommended.
Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Authenticated.
Rationale:
Unauthenticated RPC communication can create a security vulnerability.

18.8.50.1.2 (L2) Ensure 'Enable Windows NTP Server' is set to 'Disabled'
(MS only) (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to specify whether the Windows NTP Server is enabled.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: In most enterprise managed environments, you should not disable the Windows NTP
Server on Domain Controllers, as it is very important for the operation of NT5DS (domain
hierarchy-based) time synchronization.
Rationale:
The configuration of proper time synchronization is critically important in an enterprise
managed environment both due to the sensitivity of Kerberos authentication timestamps
and also to ensure accurate security logging.

Description:
This policy setting lets you control whether Microsoft accounts are optional for Windows
Store apps that require an account to sign in. This policy only affects Windows Store apps
that support it.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Enabling this setting allows an organization to use their enterprise user accounts instead of
using their Microsoft accounts when accessing Windows store apps. This provides the
organization with greater control over relevant credentials. Microsoft accounts cannot be
centrally managed and as such enterprise credential security policies cannot be applied to
them, which could put any information accessed by using Microsoft accounts at risk.

This policy setting sets the default behavior for Autorun commands. Autorun commands
are generally stored in autorun.inf files. They often launch the installation program or
other routines.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not execute any autorun
commands.
Rationale:
Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun command is inserted, the
system will automatically execute the program without user intervention. This creates a
major security concern as code may be executed without user's knowledge. The default
behavior starting with Windows Vista is to prompt the user whether autorun command is

Description:
This policy setting determines whether users can access the Insider build controls in the
Advanced Options for Windows Update. These controls are located under "Get Insider
builds," and enable users to make their devices available for downloading and installing
Windows preview software.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: This policy setting applies only to devices running Windows Server 2016, up until

builds setting (Rule 18.9.102.1.1). We have kept this setting in the benchmark to ensure
that any older builds of Windows Server 2016 in the environment are still enforced.
Rationale:
It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed
environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it
easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production-ready
builds.

EMET is free and supported security software developed by Microsoft that allows an
enterprise to apply exploit mitigations to applications that run on Windows. Many of these
mitigations were later coded directly into Windows 10 and Server 2016.
Note: Although EMET is quite effective at enhancing exploit protection on Windows server
OSes prior to Server 2016, it is highly recommended that compatibility testing is done on
typical server configurations (including all CIS-recommended EMET settings) before
widespread deployment to your environment.
Note #2: EMET has been reported to be very problematic on 32-bit OSes - we only
recommend using it with 64-bit OSes.
Note #3: Microsoft has announced that EMET will be End-Of-Life (EOL) on July 31, 2018.
This does not mean the software will stop working, only that Microsoft will not update it
any further past that date, nor troubleshoot new problems with it. They are instead

Impact:
When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most
recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
method so that older events are overwritten as needed.
The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs.
Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large
number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be
somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.
Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.
Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring
server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.
Default Value:
Disabled. (The default log size is 20,480 KB - this value can be changed by the local

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum log
file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes
(4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater.
Rationale:
If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of
system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\System:MaxSiz

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
32,768 or greater:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Event Log Service\System\Specify the maximum log file size (KB)

Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template
EventLog.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows
Administrative Templates.
Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially
named Maximum Log Size (KB), but it was renamed starting with the Windows 8.0 & Server
2012 (non-R2) Administrative Templates.

Impact:
When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most
recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
method so that older events are overwritten as needed.
The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs.
Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large
number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be
somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.
Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.
Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring
server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.
Default Value:
Disabled. (The default log size is 20,480 KB - this value can be changed by the local
administrator using the Log Properties dialog.)

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy
template SkyDrive.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server
2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer). However, we strongly recommend you only
use the version included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016
Administrative Templates (or newer). Older versions of the templates had conflicting
settings in different template files for both OneDrive & SkyDrive, until it was cleaned up
properly in the above version.
Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named
Prevent the usage of SkyDrive for file storage, but it was renamed starting with the Windows
10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates.
Impact:
Users can't access OneDrive from the OneDrive app and file picker. Windows Store apps
can't access OneDrive using the WinRT API. OneDrive doesn't appear in the navigation pane
in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the cloud. Users can't automatically
upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder.
Note: If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users
from saving files to OneDrive/SkyDrive.
Note #2: If your organization has decided to implement OneDrive for Business and
therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you also
obtain and utilize the OneDrive.admx/adml template that is bundled with the latest
OneDrive client, as noted at this link (this template is not included with the Windows
Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that
template are worth your consideration:



Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations - a computer-based
setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only approved tenant IDs.
Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts - a user-based setting
that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).

Default Value:
Disabled. (Apps and features can work with OneDrive file storage using the Next
Generation Sync Client.)

Description:
This policy setting helps prevent Remote Desktop clients from saving passwords on a
computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: If this policy setting was previously configured as Disabled or Not configured, any
previously saved passwords will be deleted the first time a Remote Desktop client
disconnects from any server.
Rationale:
An attacker with physical access to the computer may be able to break the protection
guarding saved passwords. An attacker who compromises a user's account and connects to
their computer could use saved passwords to gain access to additional hosts.

Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to restrict users to a single Remote Desktop Services session.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
This setting ensures that users & administrators who Remote Desktop to a server will
continue to use the same session - if they disconnect and reconnect, they will go back to the
same session they were using before, preventing the creation of a second simultaneous
session. This both prevents unnecessary resource usage by having the server host
unnecessary additional sessions (which would put extra load on the server) and also
ensures a consistency of experience for the user.

18.9.59.3.3.2 (L1) Ensure 'Do not allow drive redirection' is set to
'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:

Description:
This policy setting prevents users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to
Remote Desktop Servers that they access. Mapped drives appear in the session folder tree
in Windows Explorer in the following format:
\\TSClient\<driveletter>$

If local drives are shared they are left vulnerable to intruders who want to exploit the data
that is stored on them.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Data could be forwarded from the user's Remote Desktop Services session to the user's
local computer without any direct user interaction. Malicious software already present on a
compromised server would have direct and stealthy disk access to the user's local
computer during the Remote Desktop session.

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client
computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a
password prompt for users who log on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they already
provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new
Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. If the server that runs Remote Desktop Services
allows users who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their
password, then it is possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's
computer could connect to a Remote Desktop Server through the Remote Desktop
Connection shortcut, even though they may not know the user's password.

Description:
This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific security layer to secure
communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) connections.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: SSL.
Note: In spite of this setting being labelled SSL, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer
Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.
Rationale:
The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak protocol,
so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all RDP
communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred.

Impact:
Only client computers that support Network Level Authentication can connect to the RD
Session Host server.
Note: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent)
can be negatively affected by this setting, as Network Level Authentication will expect the
user's Windows password, and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along
to the Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is
present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection
may result in a failed logon attempt.

Time Limits.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template

18.9.59.3.10.1 (L2) Ensure 'Set time limit for active but idle Remote
Desktop Services sessions' is set to 'Enabled: 15 minutes or less' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of time that an active
Remote Desktop Services session can be idle (without user input) before it is automatically
disconnected.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 minutes or less.
Rationale:
This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer
for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being
consumed by large numbers of inactive sessions. In addition, old, forgotten Remote
Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password
has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the number of
connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other
users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an
effective denial of service.

Impact:
Remote Desktop Services will automatically disconnect active but idle sessions after 15
minutes (or the specified amount of time). The user receives a warning two minutes before
the session disconnects, which allows the user to press a key or move the mouse to keep
the session active. Note that idle session time limits do not apply to console sessions.

Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to configure a time limit for disconnected Remote Desktop
Services sessions.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 1 minute.
Rationale:
This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer
for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being
consumed by large numbers of disconnected but still active sessions. In addition, old,
forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the
user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the
number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions
only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting,
resulting in an effective denial of service. This setting is important to ensure a disconnected
session is properly terminated.

Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
By default, Remote Desktop Services creates a separate temporary folder on the RD Session
Host server for each active session that a user maintains on the RD Session Host server. The
temporary folder is created on the RD Session Host server in a Temp folder under the
user's profile folder and is named with the sessionid. This temporary folder is used to
store individual temporary files.
To reclaim disk space, the temporary folder is deleted when the user logs off from a
session.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Disabling this setting keeps the cached data independent for each session, both reducing
the chance of problems from shared cached data between sessions, and keeping possibly
sensitive data separate to each user session.

Description:
This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which
Microsoft has now renamed to "Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service".
Microsoft MAPS / Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online
community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also

create new definitions and help it to protect your computer.
Possible options are:




(0x0) Disabled (default)
(0x1) Basic membership
(0x2) Advanced membership

Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been
detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are
applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.
Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to
Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including
the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted
your computer.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

Rationale:
The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on
your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically
collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to
Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you or
contact you.
For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data
submissions altogether.

18.9.85 Windows Installer
This section contains recommendations related to Windows Installer.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that is
included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

18.9.85.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow user control over installs' is set to 'Disabled'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that
typically are available only to system administrators. The security features of Windows
Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically
reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are
installed. If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user
to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message. These
security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged
security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
In an enterprise managed environment, only IT staff with administrative rights should be
installing or changing software on a system. Allowing users the ability to have any control
over installs can risk unapproved software from being installed or removed from a system,
which could cause the system to become vulnerable to compromise.

18.9.85.2 (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to
'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions
when it installs any program on the system.
Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration
folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.
Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants
to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note
that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer
installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in
Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group,
installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

18.9.95.1 (L1) Ensure 'Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging' is set to
'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting enables logging of all PowerShell script input to the Microsoft-WindowsPowerShell/Operational event log.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: In Microsoft's own hardening guidance, they recommend the opposite value,
Enabled, because having this data logged improves investigations of PowerShell attack
incidents. However, the default ACL on the PowerShell Operational log allows Interactive
User (i.e. any logged on user) to read it, and therefore possibly expose passwords or other
sensitive information to unauthorized users. If Microsoft locks down the default ACL on
that log in the future (e.g. to restrict it only to Administrators), then we will revisit this
recommendation in a future release.
Rationale:
There are potential risks of capturing passwords in the PowerShell logs. This setting should
only be needed for debugging purposes, and not in normal operation, it is important to
ensure this is set to Disabled.

18.9.98 Windows Remote Shell
This section contains settings related to Windows Remote Shell (WinRS).
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template
WindowsRemoteShell.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft
Windows Administrative Templates.

18.9.98.1 (L2) Ensure 'Allow Remote Shell Access' is set to 'Disabled'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to manage configuration of remote access to all supported
shells to execute scripts and commands.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: The GPME help text for this setting is incorrectly worded, implying that configuring it
to Enabled will reject new Remote Shell connections, and setting it to Disabled will allow
Remote Shell connections. The opposite is true (and is consistent with the title of the
setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.
Rationale:
Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections
are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on trusted
networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec.

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy object is backed by the following registry location:

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:
Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows
Remote Shell\Allow Remote Shell Access

Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template
WindowsRemoteShell.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft
Windows Administrative Templates.
Impact:
New Remote Shell connections are not allowed and are rejected by the server.
Note: On Server 2012 (non-R2) and newer, due to design changes in the OS after Server
2008 R2, configuring this setting as prescribed will prevent the ability to add or remove
Roles and Features (even locally) via the GUI. We therefore recommend that the necessary
Roles and Features be installed prior to configuring this setting on a Level 2 server.
Alternatively, Roles and Features can still be added or removed using the PowerShell
commands Add-WindowsFeature or Remove-WindowsFeature in the Server Manager
module, even with this setting configured.
Default Value:
Enabled. (New Remote Shell connections are allowed.)

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable preview builds.

845 | P a g e

Rationale:
It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed

18.9.102.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Select when Preview Builds and Feature
Updates are received' is set to 'Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or
more days' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines the level of Preview Build or Feature Updates to receive, and
when.
The Windows readiness level for each new Windows 10 Feature Update is classified in one
of 5 categories, depending on your organizations level of comfort with receiving them:








Preview Build - Fast: Devices set to this level will be the first to receive new builds
of Windows with features not yet available to the general public. Select Fast to
participate in identifying and reporting issues to Microsoft, and provide suggestions
on new functionality.
Preview Build - Slow: Devices set to this level receive new builds of Windows
before they are available to the general public, but at a slower cadence than those
set to Fast, and with changes and fixes identified in earlier builds.
Release Preview: Receive builds of Windows just before Microsoft releases them to
the general public.
Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted): Receive feature updates when they are released
to the general public.
Semi-Annual Channel: Feature updates will arrive when they are declared SemiAnnual Channel. This usually occurs about 4 months after Semi-Annual Channel
(Targeted), indicating that Microsoft, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs),
partners and customer believe that the release is ready for broad deployment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more
days.
Note: If the "Allow Telemetry" policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.

Note #2: Starting with Windows Server 2016 RTM (Release 1607), Microsoft introduced a
new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based
update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows
Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you
are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not
Configured or configure the setting Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans
against Windows Update (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative
Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on
Dual Scan is available at these links:

Improving Dual Scan on 1607 – WSUS Product Team Blog

Note #3: Prior to Windows Server 2016 R1709, values above 180 days are not recognized
by the OS. Starting with Windows Server 2016 R1709, the maximum number of days you
can defer is 365 days.
Rationale:
Forcing new features without prior testing in your environment could cause software
incompatibilities as well as introducing new bugs into the operating system. In an
enterprise managed environment, it is generally preferred to delay Feature Updates until
thorough testing and a deployment plan is in place. This recommendation delays the
automatic installation of new features as long as possible.

18.9.102.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Automatic Updates' is set to 'Enabled'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting specifies whether computers in your environment will receive security
updates from Windows Update or WSUS. If you configure this policy setting to Enabled, the
operating system will recognize when a network connection is available and then use the
network connection to search Windows Update or your designated intranet site for
updates that apply to them.
After you configure this policy setting to Enabled, select one of the following three options
in the Configure Automatic Updates Properties dialog box to specify how the service will
work:





2 - Notify for download and auto install (Notify before downloading any updates)
3 - Auto download and notify for install (Download the updates automatically and
notify when they are ready to be installed.) (Default setting)
4 - Auto download and schedule the install (Automatically download updates and
install them on the schedule specified below.))
5 - Allow local admin to choose setting (Leave decision on above choices up to the
local Administrators (Not Recommended))

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: The sub-setting "Configure automatic updating:" has 4 possible values – all of them
are valid depending on specific organizational needs, however if feasible we suggest using a
value of 4 - Auto download and schedule the install. This suggestion is not a scored
requirement.
Note #2: Organizations that utilize a 3rd-party solution for patching may choose to exempt
themselves from this setting, and instead configure it to Disabled so that the native
Windows Update mechanism does not interfere with the 3rd-party patching process.

853 | P a g e

Rationale:
Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that
problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic
Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always
have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

19.7.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Do not preserve zone information in file
attachments' is set to 'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments with
information about their zone of origin (such as restricted, Internet, intranet, local). This
requires NTFS in order to function correctly, and will fail without notice on FAT32. By not
preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Note: The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which
are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has
been removed via the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such
as Microsoft Sysinternals Streams.
Rationale:
A file that is downloaded from a computer in the Internet or Restricted Sites zone may be
moved to a location that makes it appear safe, like an intranet file share, and executed by an
unsuspecting user. The Attachment Manager feature will warn users when opening or
executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's
zone information has been removed.

19.7.26 Network Sharing
This section contains recommendations related to Network Sharing.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template Sharing.admx/adml
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

19.7.26.1 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent users from sharing files within their
profile.' is set to 'Enabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This policy setting determines whether users can share files within their profile. By default,
users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their network after an
administrator opts in the computer. An administrator can opt in the computer by using the
sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
If not properly configured, a user could accidentally share sensitive data with unauthorized
users. In an enterprise managed environment, the company should provide a managed
location for file sharing, such as a file server or SharePoint, instead of the user sharing files
directly from their own user profile.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_USERS\[USER
SID]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer:NoInplaceSha
ring

895 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Network Sharing\Prevent users from sharing files within their
profile.

Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template Sharing.admx/adml
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.
Impact:
Users cannot share files within their profile using the sharing wizard. Also, the sharing
wizard cannot create a share at %root%\Users and can only be used to create SMB shares
on folders.
Default Value:
Disabled. (Users can share files out of their user profile after an administrator has opted in
the computer.)

This section contains recommendations related to Windows Installer.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that is
included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

19.7.41.1 (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to
'Disabled' (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 1 - Domain Controller
Level 1 - Member Server
Description:
This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions
when it installs any program on the system.
Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration
folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.
Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants
to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note
that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer
installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in
Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group,
installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_USERS\[USER
SID]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer:AlwaysInstallElevated

901 | P a g e

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:
User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Windows Installer\Always install with elevated privileges

Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that
is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.
Impact:
None - this is the default behavior.
Default Value:
Disabled. (Windows Installer will apply the current user's permissions when it installs
programs that a system administrator does not distribute or offer. This will prevent
standard users from installing applications that affect system-wide configuration items.)

19.7.45.2.1 (L2) Ensure 'Prevent Codec Download' is set to 'Enabled'
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
Level 2 - Domain Controller
Level 2 - Member Server
Description:
This setting controls whether Windows Media Player is allowed to download additional
codecs for decoding media files it does not already understand.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

904 | P a g e

Rationale:
This has some potential for risk if a malicious data file is opened in Media Player that
requires an additional codec to be installed. If a special codec is required for a necessary
job function, then that codec should first be tested to ensure it is legitimate, and it should
be supplied by the IT department in the organization.
Audit:
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:
HKEY_USERS\[USER
SID]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsMediaPlayer:PreventCodecDownload

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Windows Media Player\Playback\Prevent Codec Download

Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template
WindowsMediaPlayer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft
Windows Administrative Templates.
Impact:
Windows Media Player is prevented from automatically downloading codecs to your
computer. In addition, the Download codecs automatically check box on the Player tab in
the Player is not available.
Default Value:
Users can change the setting for the Download codecs automatically check box.
